# GradeCalculator
This is just a simple Java program that can be used to calculate an overall grade for a class. You can enter in what you're being graded on (ex: Homework, Quizzes, Exams, etc), enter in the weightage for each category you're being graded on, 
then enter your average score for each category, and when you're done the program will then display the overall grade along with the averages for each category.
